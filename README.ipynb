    "# Dimensional Analysis\n",
    "This interactive Jupyter-Notebook (Python 3) determines the dimensionless parameters for a given set of physical variables in accordance with the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "Enter a single string with symbols of physical variables (separated by spaces). Choose the symbols from a collection of available variables here: [physical-variables.tsv](physical-variables.tsv). The code determines the dimensional matrix and the number $d$ of independent dimensionless parameters that can be formed from these variables. Finally, if dimensionless parameters could be found, one specific set (of infinitely many possible solutions) is presented in a visually appealing way.\n",

    "This Jupyter-Notebook can find solutions for these $k$-exponents and thus provide one possible set of dimensionless parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "For a detailed description of this procedure please referre to [\"Dimensional Analysis for Engineers\" by Simon, Weigand and Gomaa](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-52028-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential Order of Symbols in the Input-String\n",
    "When more than one dimensionless parameter is expected (i.e. $d >1$) the order of the symbols in the input string is very important. Different orders will result in different sets of dimensionless parameters. These sets are all valid solutions, but not all sets are equally practical or useful to work with going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependent / Independent Variables\n",
    "A rule of thumb is that the dependent variable should be placed in the leftmost position and the independent variables in the rightmost position. In the example above the drag force $F_D$ is the dependent variable and the remaining variables are all independent. Think of a wind tunnel test that examines the drag force of a sphere. The researchers can directly influence the independent variables. They can change the flow velocity $u$ and the fluid properties $\\eta$ and $\\rho$ independently; and of course they can investigate spheres of different sizes $D$. The drag force is influenced by these independent variables and is therefore a dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the advantage that the dependent variable, when placed in the leftmost position, appears in only one of the dimensionless parameters and can thus be conveniently isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Property of Rightmost Rectangular Submatrix\n",
    "In fact, the $d$ leftmost variables will all appear only in one dimensionless parameter. On the other hand the $r$ rightmost variables might appear in all dimensionless parameters. Roughly speaking, the $r$ rightmost variables are used to de-dimensionalize the $d$ leftmost variables. Therefore, the dimensional vectors of the $r$ rightmost variables must be linear independent, so that they can *build* all the required dimensions in the given dimensional vector space. For example, if our physics problem contains the variables $T_{wall}$ and $T_{air}$, we must not put these two variables (of the same dimension) inside the $r$ rightmost positions, as this would result in linear dependent vectors!\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure solves a linear system of equations by means of matrix inversion. The matrix in question (the rightmost rectangular submatrix of the dimensional matrix) must not be singular, i.e. its determinant must not be zero! \n",
    "\n",
    "**If this is not the case (i.e. the submatrix is singular), then the symbols in the input-string must be rearanged before we can proceed!**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed instruction on how the variables should be ordered, please referre to [\"Applied Dimensional Analysis and Modeling\" by Szirtes and Rózsa](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-370620-1.X5000-X), which I highly recommend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "### Drag Force of Sphere - Version 2\n",
    "Here the string contains the same variables as the example above. However, in the sequential order the positions of **u** and **eta** are switched.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variables = 'F_D eta u rho D'\n",

    ">$\n",
    "{\\Pi_1}^* = \\frac{F_D}{D^2 \\rho u^2}\\\\\n",
    "{\\Pi_2}^* = \\frac{\\eta}{D \\rho u}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $d$ leftmost variables are $F_D$ and $\\eta$. Therefore, $F_D$ appears only in ${\\Pi_1}^*$ and $\\eta$ appears only in ${\\Pi_2}^*$. The independent variables $u$, $\\rho$ and $D$ appear in both dimensionless parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both resulting sets of dimensionless parameter are equally valid. However, in the second set we recognize that ${\\Pi_1}^*$ represents (except for a constant) the commonly used drag coefficient $c_D$. In the first example we directly obtained the Reynolds number ($\\Pi_2 =  Re$), whereas in the second example we obtained the reciprocal of the Reynolds number (${\\Pi_2}^* =  \\frac{1}{Re}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we went with the first sequential order, all hope is not lost. We could still arrive at the  form of the commonly used drag coefficient. Since the square of a dimensionless parameter is still dimensionless and also the product of two dimensionless parameters is still dimensionless, we can combine the parameters to obtain a new (equally valid) parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\n",
    "\\Pi_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{{\\Pi_2}^2} = \\frac{F_D \\rho}{\\eta^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\eta^2}{D^2 \\rho^2 u^2} = \\frac{F_D}{D^2 \\rho u^2} = {\\Pi_1}^*\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forced Convection Heat Transfer\n",
    "We are interessted in the heat transfer coefficient $h$ (dependent variable) for a cooling channel with the diameter $D$ (independent variable), the flow velocity $u$ (independent variable) and following fluid properties: specific heat capacity $c_p$, density $\\rho$, dynamic viscosity $\\eta$ and thermal conductivity $k_{th}$ (all independent variables).\n",
